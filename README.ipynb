    "# Getting started with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a step-by-step guide on how to prepare your computer for running Python scripts including the batch processing, found in our snazzy CDN-Lab Github : https://github.com/CDN-Lab/ \n",
    "\n",
    "After completing these four steps, you will have a working Conda environment where you can run many python scripts that depend on some common Python libraries: matplotlib, ipython, pandas, numpy, and scipy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Important* if you are doing this for the first time, follow steps 1-4 closely. If you have completed steps 1-4 before and just need to reactivate your conda environment, skip ahead to step 5 below \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Download miniconda files \n",
    "\n",
    "- Look up which chip/processor you have : [use directions here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211814#:~:text=To%20open%20About%20This%20Mac,name%20of%20an%20Intel%20processor.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to our Sharepoint [miniconda](https://nih.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/NIMH-CDNlab/Shared%20Documents/Code/miniconda?csf=1&web=1&e=L5gLrH) and download the Miniconda3 installer file appropriate for your chip/processor: \n",
    "> (M1 chip) : Miniconda3-py39_22.11.1-1-MacOSX-arm64.sh  \n",
    "> (Intel) : Miniconda3-py39_22.11.1-1-MacOSX-x86_64.sh  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you cannot access our Sharepoint you should be able to find the installer in the [Conda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Please track the location in your computer where the file is downloaded. We *will* need this specific path in step 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "> /path_to_file/Miniconda3-py39_22.11.1-1-MacOSX-***64.sh \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Prepare directories \n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduction to using a Terminal : [short tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKRYQsKR46I). We will use a `$` to denote that we are running a function from the terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Open Terminal, and in your home directory, make a directory called \"IDM_project\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ mkdir IDM_project \n",
    "    \n",
    "    $ cd IDM_project \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Git clone CPU_support \n",
    "\n",
    "- To start using the code in this repository, you have to create a copy of everything here on your own computer. To do this you can simply open a command window on your computer and run the following code. Inside the IDM_project directory, clone the CPU_support repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git clone https://github.com/CDN-Lab/CPU_support \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ cd CPU_support \n",
    "\n",
    "If your computer does not have `git` you can download from [their website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Execute python script setup_conda.py \n",
    "\n",
    "- Run python scripts with python3. You can check python version with: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python –-version \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python3 --version \n",
    "\n",
    "- [ optional ] Run the help command to familiarize yourself with the script \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python3 setup_conda.py --help \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use setup_conda.py to install Conda: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python3 setup_conda.py -ip ~/Downloads/Miniconda3-py39_22.11.1-1-MacOSX-***64.sh -dp /path_to_conda \n",
    "\n",
    "* NOTE: * You can omit the –dp field, in which case, miniconda will be installed in your home directory: /Users/username/opt/ \n",
    "\n",
    "- Source the miniconda environment: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ source /path_to_conda/miniconda/bin/activate \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use setup_conda.py again to create conda environment: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python3 setup_conda.py --create_environment \n",
    "\n",
    "* NOTE: * If this step does not work, you may need to copy the .condarc file to the home directory \n",
    "\n",
    "- Activate the conda_environment, now you can run the batch processing script \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ conda activate idm_env \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conda already set up? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have already gone through steps 1-4 and just need to activate your conda environment, do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Source the miniconda environment: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ source /path_to_conda/miniconda/bin/activate \n",
    "\n",
    "- Activate the conda_environment, now you can run the batch processing script \n",
